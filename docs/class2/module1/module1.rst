Module 1 - Solutions for VMware View
====================================

The purpose of this module is to build out 3 basic VMware View
architectures leveraging F5 load balancing and authentication
functionality. Each student will access a separate instance of a common
blueprint in the Ravello cloud.

Note: Each student will be given IP addresses for the “Internal”
(corporate-pc) and “External”(home-pc) Windows workstation clients. The
student will use RDP functionality on their personal laptop to access
these devices to test the environment. All other addresses will be
common across all labs

Objective:

-  Construct VMware View implementations with F5 LTM and APM software
   modules

-  Familiarize student with F5 iApp templates

Lab Requirements:

-  Laptop with RDP functionality

Estimated completion time: 60 Minutes
